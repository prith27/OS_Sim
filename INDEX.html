     <h2>Process Scheduling</h2><br>
        <p>The process scheduling is the activity of the process manager that handles the removal of the running process from the CPU and the selection of another process on the basis of a particular strategy.Process scheduling allows OS to allocate a time interval of CPU execution for each process. Another important reason for using a process scheduling system is that it keeps the CPU busy all the time. This allows you to get the minimum response time for programs.</p>

Each of the process will get the CPU for a small amount of time (called time quantum) and then get back to the ready queue to wait for its next turn. It is a preemptive type of scheduling.</p>

     <h2>Memory Management (Fixed Partition)</h2><br>
        <p>Memory management is the functionality of an operating system which handles or manages primary memory and moves processes back and forth between main memory and disk during execution. Memory management keeps track of each and every memory location, regardless of either it is allocated to some process or it is free. It checks how much memory is to be allocated to processes. It decides which process will get memory at what time. It tracks whenever some memory gets freed or unallocated and correspondingly it updates the status.</p>

      <h5 class="mb-1">First Fit</h5>
    </div>
    <p class="mb-1">First Fit fits data into memory by scanning from the beginning of available memory to the end, until the first free space which is at least big enough to accept the data is found.This space is then allocated to the data.Any left over becomes a smaller, separate free space..</p>

      <h5 class="mb-1">Worst Fit</h5>
    </div>
    <p class="mb-1">Worst Fit allocates a process to the partition which is largest sufficient among the freely available partitions available in the main memory. If a large process comes at a later stage, then memory will not have space to accommodate it.</p>

    <div class="d-flex w-100 justify-content-between">
      <h5 class="mb-1">Best Fit</h5>
    </div>
    <p class="mb-1">The best fit deals with allocating the smallest free partition which meets the requirement of the requesting process. This algorithm first searches the entire list of free partitions and considers the smallest hole that is adequate. It then tries to find a hole which is close to actual process size needed.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="mb-1">Next fit is another version of First Fit in which memory is searched for empty spaces similar to the first fit memory allocation scheme.This memory allocation scheme uses a moving pointer which moves along the empty memory slots to search memory for the next fit.</p>

     <h2>File System</h2><br>
        <p>A file is a collection of correlated information which is recorded on secondary or non-volatile storage like magnetic disks, optical disks, and tapes. It is a method of data collection that is used as a medium for giving input and receiving output from that program.In general, a file is a sequence of bits, bytes, or records whose meaning is defined by the file creator and user. Every File has a logical location where they are located for storage and retrieval.In computing, a file system or filesystem (often abbreviated to fs) controls how data is stored and retrieved. Without a file system, data placed in a storage medium would be one large body of data with no way to tell where one piece of data stops and the next begins. By separating the data into pieces and giving each piece a name, the data is easily isolated and identified. </p>

    </div>
    <p class="mb-1">Single level directory structure has only one directory which is called the root directory. The users are not allowed to create subdirectories under the root directory. All the files created by the several users are present in the root directory only.There is one drawback of Single-level directory structure, a user cannot use the same file name used by another user in the system. Even if the file with the same name is created the old file will get destroyed first and replaced by the new file having the same name.</p>
